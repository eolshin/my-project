      <h1>Revise a Resume Project Tutorial</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to this Revise a Resume project tutorial! Follow the steps below to customize this resume and make it reflect your qualifications and accomplishments as a webpage builder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure not to include any personal information not called for by the tutorial. If you're an adult, feel free to add any information you'd like later. If you're not an adult, get help and permission from a parent or guardian deciding what  information to share online.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Pay special attention to which information appears inside heading tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> through <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>, which information appears inside paragraphs with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag and which information appears inside unordered lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) using the list item tag, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.
      </p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          <h4>
            Change your name
          </h4>
          <p>
            Change the name at <code>line 23</code> of the file called <code>index.html</code> (which you can find in the FILES sidebar on the left) to a name you want to use for this project. If you want to use your own name, for now, don't use anything more than your first name and last initial.</p>
          
          <p>If that feels like too much information to share, maybe just use your first initial or a name you make up for this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leave the fake, non-existant address alone for now.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Change your objective
          </h4>
          <p>
            Think about what you want to achieve with this resume. Is there a particular educational program or opportunity you want to participate in to develp your skills as a webpage builder? Is there a job you want? Or a role - like, "To become the best shoe-blogger in the world?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Revise the objective at <code>line 40</code> of <code>index.html</code> to reflect your goal in composing and sharing this resume.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Change your education
          </h4>
          <p>
            Beginning at <code>line 47</code> of <code>index.html</code>, change the educational experiences listed on the resume to match your own experiences in learning how to make a webpage. List the dates and names of any and all learning opportunities that helped you make it this far.</p>
          <p><strong>You do not need to list when or where these educational experiences took place if you feel like that's too much information to share.</strong>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Change your experiences
          </h4>
          <p>
            Next, beginning at <code>line 55</code> of <code>index.html</code>, list the experiences you've had that have let you apply what you know about building webpages. Maybe you helped update a family member's business page or set up a website for a school publication.</p>
          <p>Remember to include the date, the name of the experience, and a brief description of what you did after the line-break tags - <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> - in each item.
          </p>
          <p><strong>You do not need to list when or where these webpage building experiences took place if you feel like that's too much information to share.</strong>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Change your skills
          </h4>
          <p>
            Start at <code>line 64</code> of <code>index.html</code> and list all of the webpage building skills you've gained so far. You might list things like, "Familiar with common HTML tags and webpage structure," or, "Experienced with basic webpage design in HTML."
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Change your languages
          </h4>
          <p>
            If you've worked with any CSS, JavaScript, or other programming platforms before, you can note them at <code>line 71</code> of <code>index.html</code> by adding new list items.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Style your information
          </h4>
          <p>
            Review your resume and think through which pieces of information you really want to emphasize for your reader. Add bold (<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>), italics (<code>&lt;em&gt;</code>), or underline (<code>&lt;u&gt;</code>) tags to highlight essential information on your resume.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Nicely done! You've revised your own webpage-builder resume to share your qualifications and accomplishments online. Feel free to update the resume - or to create a new copy - and use it to pursue educational and career opportunities that interest you. If you're not an adult, be sure to talk with a parent or guardian before adding any more personal information to the page.
